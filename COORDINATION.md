| Scout | vector-gridiron / training pipeline | 22:08 CDT | Bring training in-repo, fix 16-d vs 32-d vs 64-d confusion | scout/gridiron-train-in-repo | in-progress |
| Scout | vector-unified + vector-hub | 22:08 CDT | Push G2 sport-blind 0.685→0.64, verify ablation table | scout/unified-g2-blind | in-progress |
| Scout | dottie / nano 1k + tech debt | 22:08 CDT | First real nano 1k steps, scrub cache, unify checkpoint paths | scout/dottie-nano-1k | in-progress |

| Claude-Local | vector-unified / LOCAL-GPU G2 push | 16:4x CDT | **BLOCKED — see COORDINATION_LOCAL_GPU_BLOCKER.md.** The Hatch patches the handoff depends on are not reachable from this box. | local/claim-board | blocked |
| Claude-Local | vector-pitch / verify + push (free lane) | 16:4x CDT | DONE — 13/13 green, json.tool clean, rebased + pushed to pitch master a36b48d. Handoff's 0904a39 / vectors_mtnn.json do not exist here; the seed work shipped instead. | master (ff) | done |

## How to use
1. Add your row before editing
2. Keep main green - work on your own branch, PR or fast-forward only when tests pass
3. New assets = candidate.json -> promote only when eval beats current + gate passes
4. Log even if no change ("checked, no-op") so others know you looked
5. Clear row when done
